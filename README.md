## 📁 File Structure

```
aif-c01-quiz/
├── index.html        ← The quiz app (never needs editing)
├── questions.json    ← All questions — edit this to add/update questions
└── README.md
```

> **Key principle:** `index.html` loads `questions.json` at runtime via `fetch()`.  
> To update questions, **only edit `questions.json`** — never touch `index.html`.

## ➕ Adding New Questions

1. Open `questions.json`
2. Scroll to the last `}` before the closing `]`
3. Add a comma after it, then your new question object
4. Save, commit, push → live site updates automatically

```json
  ... existing last question ...
  },         ← add comma here
  {
    "id": 303,
    "question": "Your new question text here?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Option A",
      "B": "Option B",
      "C": "Option C",
      "D": "Option D"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "topic": "Bedrock"
  }
]            ← closing bracket, no comma
```

## ❌ Common Mistakes

```jsonc
// ❌ Wrong topic spelling
"topic": "ML Concepts"          // missing "AI / "
"topic": "bedrock"              // must be "Bedrock"
"topic": "Responsible AI & Security"  // must be "Responsible AI"

// ❌ Trailing comma on last item
  { "id": 303, ... },   // comma before ] will break JSON
]

// ❌ Answer key not in options
"answer": "E"           // only valid if options has an "E" key
```
